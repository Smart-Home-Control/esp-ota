# esp-ota

[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/donate-%3C3-blueviolet.svg)](https://donorbox.org/bitfocus-esp-ota)

A library for uploading firmware or SPIFFS filesystem to ESP32 devices that uses `ArduinoOTA`.

It uses promises for main operation. But you can listen for 'state' and 'progress' events to get more information during the file transfer.

## Installation

```bash
npm install esp-ota
```

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use this in a console-environment:

```js
var EspOTA = require('esp-ota');

var esp = new EspOTA();

esp.uploadFirmware('/path/to/firmware.bin', '10.0.0.1', 3232)
	.then(function () {
		console.log("Done");
	})
	.catch(function (error) {
		console.error("Transfer error: ", error);
	});
```


Here's a more elaborate example showing more of the possibilities.

```js
var EspOTA = require('esp-ota');

var esp = new EspOTA(); // Optional arguments in this order: (bindAddress, bindPort, chunkSize, secondsTimeout)

esp.on('state', function (state) {
	console.log("Current state of transfer: ", state);
});

esp.on('progress', function (current, total) {
	console.log("Transfer progress: " + Math.round(current / total * 100) + "%");
});

// If you need to authenticate, uncomment the following and change the password
// esp.setPassword('admin');

var transfer = esp.uploadFirmware('/path/to/firmware.bin', '10.0.0.1', 3232);

transfer
	.then(function () {
		console.log("Done");
	})
	.catch(function (error) {
		console.error("Transfer error: ", error);
	});
```

## Methods

* `setPassword(password)` - Set password before transfer
* `uploadFirmware(filename, address, port)` - Transfer firmware to the device using the specified ip and port. This function returns a `Promise` that will succeed when the file is done transferring and accepted by the device. The default port is set to 3232.
* `uploadSPIFFS(filename, address, port)` - Transfer SPIFFS filesystem to the device using the specified ip and port. This function returns a `Promise` that will succeed when the file is done transferring and accepted by the device. The default port is set to 3232.
* `uploadFile(filename, address, port, target)` - Main Transfer method for files to target sections using the specified ip, port and target. This function returns a `Promise` that will succeed when the file is done transferring and accepted by the device. The default port is set to `8266` and target is `U_FLASH`.
* `uploadBuffer(filename, address, port, target)` - Main Transfer method for Buffers to target sections using the specified ip, port and target. This function returns a `Promise` that will succeed when the file is done transferring and accepted by the device. The default port is set to `8266` and target is `U_FLASH`.
* `on()` - This class extends the `EventEmitter` class, and exposes two events; `state` and `progress`.

## Flashing Targets

Use these Targets with `uploadFile` or `uploadBuffer` Methods to specify the flashing Target.

* `esp.TARGET.U_FLASH` - Upload to Main Flash.
* `esp.TARGET.U_SPIFFS` - Upload to File System.

## Possible "states"

Using the `.on('state')` event listener you can get the following events:

 * `invite_sent` - This means that a special UDP packet has been sent to the device to invite it to connect to us to download new data.
 * `resend_invite` - If nothing happens in 2 seconds, a new invite is sent. For up to 5 retries.
 * `invite_timeout` - It timed out in the invitation process. This usually either means that it has no connection with the device. But this is also eventually emitted if authentication fails, since the device fails silently.
 * `need_auth` - The device requires authentication to continue. If you have set the password previously, it will try to authenticate. If not, please set the correct password with the `.setPassword()` command before trying to upload.
 * `auth_sent` - Authentication attempt is sent to the device.
 * `invite_accepted` - The device reports that it is ready to transfer data.
 * `connected` - The device has connected to us via TCP, to receive data. This may or may not arrive before `invite_accepted`.
 * `transfer_timeout` - The transfer timed out. If this happens after you have seen that progress has transferred all data, there is a possibility that the transfer aborted due to the file transfer being corrupted. (The device checks the MD5sum of the transferred file before it accepts the new firmware and reboots)
 * `done` - The transfer was successful, and the device is now rebooting.

## Installing the ArduinoOTA counterpart in your ESP32 code

```c++
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <ArduinoOTA.h>

const char* ssid = "..........";
const char* password = "..........";

void setup() {
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.waitForConnectResult() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.println("Connection Failed! Rebooting...");
    delay(5000);
    ESP.restart();
  }

  // If you want authentication, uncomment this line
  // ArduinoOTA.setPassword("admin");

  ArduinoOTA.begin();
}

void loop() {
  ArduinoOTA.handle();
}
```
